# Changelog

# v2.2.1

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a compatibility issue with other mods that also use the image4j library. ([#45](https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/issues/45))

# v2.2.0

## New features

### Simplified config

Some config options have been removed or changed to simplify the config and make things easier. **Existing config files will be automatically migrated to the new format on launch, so you don't need to worry about losing your settings.**

- A new option has been added called `modpackName` in the `[Display.General]` section
    - If left blank, itlt will attempt to automatically detect the name of the modpack you're using from supported launchers
    - Otherwise the name you set will be used
- `%autoName` has been renamed to `%modpackName`, but the old placeholder variable will still work for now

# v2.1.5

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bug that caused itlt to wrongly get blamed for other mod's crashes in certain situations ([#34](https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/issues/34), [#39](https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/issues/39))

# v2.1.4

## Bug fixes

-   Hotfix: Fixed a migration error due to a silly programming mistake again in v2.1.3.

## Other changes

-   The amount of variables I need to change for migration to work properly has been significantly reduced, hopefully preventing the bug from happening again.
-   All the changes from v2.1.3 (see below)

# v2.1.3

## Other changes

-   Minor performance improvements

# v2.1.2

## MC 1.18-specific changes

-   The minimum Forge version to run itlt on MC 1.18 has been raised to 38.0.17 to make sure people are protected against the log4j security flaw (CVE-2021-44228)

## Bug fixes

-   Hotfix: Fixed an issue causing config files to wrongly be deleted due to a programming mistake in v2.1.1.
    - A backup is made on first load with v2.1.1. You can restore the backup by deleting `itlt-client.toml` in the config folder and changing `itlt-client.toml.bak` to `itlt-client.toml`
    - Once the backup is restored, update itlt to v2.1.2 to fix the issue.
    - It is recommended that all v2.1.1 users update to v2.1.2 if they want a non-default config take effect.
-   As usual, all the fixes from v2.1.1 (see below)

# v2.1.1

## MC 1.18-specific bug fixes

-   Fixed a typo seen when running the itlt jar directly where it wrongly tells you to put the jar in the mods folder of a Minecraft Forge 1.17.x instance (it should say 1.18.x for the 1.18.x jar)

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a crash on launch if the game is launched near the root of a drive. ([#38](https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/issues/38))
-   Fixed an issue causing launcher integration features not working on some Linux systems ([#37](https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/issues/37))

# v2.1.0

## MC 1.18-specific changes

-   itlt now supports MC 1.18
-   Gradle 7.3.1
-   Default config for min Java version matches MC 1.18's min requirement of Java 17

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bug in config generation that caused every group to be inside the Java group.
    -   Configs made older versions that had this bug will be automatically fixed to work on this version.
-   Fixed a startup crash on some macOS systems

## New features

### Welcome screen

You can now optionally show a screen on first launch. This could be used to show a changelog, give advice to new users or provide links to your pack's social media for example.

![](https://zlepper.github.io/itlt/docs/changelogs/v2.1.0/WelcomeScreen.png)

The welcome screen supports MC formatting codes for different colours and styles, headings, clickable links, word-wrapping and scrolling. Simply enable the config option and edit the `config/itlt/welcome.txt` file.

Note: This feature is experimental. It is stable, but may change in a future release. I will mention in the changelog if this feature receives any breaking changes. 

### Improved custom window title feature

Vanilla changes the window title based on what you're doing (e.g. it mentions "Singleplayer" when playing a singleplayer world).

Before v2.1.0, itlt didn't support this feature and kept the window title static. v2.1.0 now supports this feature.

### Config migration

itlt now automatically migrates old configs to the version you're running and makes a backup, allowing you to update to a version of itlt containing otherwise breaking config changes without needing to fix your config manually. The backup is deleted on second launch.

This basically means that if the config format changes in newer versions, itlt will automatically convert your previous config file to work with the latest version, preserving your existing preferences where possible.

This feature currently supports migrating from v2.0.0/v2.0.1 to v2.1.0. Support for migrating configs from older versions is currently unimplemented.

### Improved config validation

To help troubleshooting mistakes with your config, the mod now logs an error if you set requirements that are impossible to meet (e.g. requiring that the user simultaneously uses at least Java 11 but not newer than Java 8).

Additionally, ranges have been added to the min/max memory config options to prevent them being accidentally set to a negative value.

## Other changes

-   Minor performance improvements
-   itlt will no longer log when it can't find the config/itlt/ folder but successfully created it for you - instead, it will now only let you know if you need to manually do it yourself
-   Fixed a couple of typos in the config

# v2.0.1

This release adds support for MC 1.17.1 and fixes a couple of bugs that caused crash on launch issues for some users as well as minor performance improvements and other changes.

## MC 1.17-specific changes

-   itlt now supports MC 1.17.1
-   Using a JS coremod instead of Mixin for custom window title handling
-   Updated config defaults to reflect MC 1.17's new Java requirements
-   ForgeGradle 5.1, Gradle 7.2, MojMap
-   The code now takes full advantage of modern Java features when available and support for modern Java has been improved
-   Improved support for Java 17

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a startup crash on system locales that separate decimal points with commas (#24)
-   The "Enhanced Vanilla Icon" logic no longer unnecessarily runs when a valid custom icon is provided

## Other changes

-   Icon handling has been made more robust and can now continue to use an icon when it contains corrupt/invalid embedded images, as long as at least one embedded image is okay
-   Improved debug logging and error messages for icon handling

# v2.0.0

With v2 of itlt, everything has been written from the ground-up with a goal on being the best at the specific little things it does.

## Breaking changes

Everything's changed so this release is not compatible with existing v1 configs. The default behaviour of auto-detecting the modpack's icon and title is still in place.

## New features

### Full multi-lingual support

All features in itlt v2 should support different languages, allowing it to be localised to your desired language rather than being forced to read English. This includes features outside of the game, such as the warning and requirements system

### Improved launcher integration

itlt now uses a more modular system for launcher detection and integration and supports many different launchers. While v1 supported the Technic Launcher, v2 also supports MultiMC, Curse Client, FTB App and the Forge Dev Env.

### Warning and requirements system

You can now let people know when they haven't allocated enough RAM at launch with a helpful pop-up. Or if they're using the wrong Java version or architecture. Or if they're allocating waaaay too much RAM, or a combination of the above.

These things can be set multiple times separately as warnings and requirements - where warnings are considered recommendations, requirements are considered "this modpack won't start or will crash if not met".

Using the new launcher integration features, the guides are tailored to the launcher your players are using, making it easier to find what settings to change to get your pack running.

There's also now the ability for your users to "Don't ask again" for specific warnings. This remembers a user's preference to ignore a specific warning but still have warnings they haven't seen before to be shown.

Here's a couple of examples of what your users could see, depending on how you configure it:

![](https://zlepper.github.io/itlt/docs/changelogs/v2.0.0/WantsMoreMemory.png)

![](https://zlepper.github.io/itlt/docs/changelogs/v2.0.0/NeedsNewerJava.png)

Here's a list of supported warnings (shown as "Wants") and requirements (shown as "Needs") in v2.0.0:

-   NeedsJava64bit
-   WantsJava64bit
-   NeedsMoreMemory
-   WantsMoreMemory
-   NeedsLessMemory
-   WantsLessMemory
-   NeedsNewerJava
-   WantsNewerJava
-   NeedsOlderJava
-   WantsOlderJava

### Overhauled custom icon handling

The new icon handling system supports ICO, ICNS and PNG files as well as launcher integration for automatically detecting and using your modpack's icon from its platform listing.

With Hi-DPI and multi-size ICO and ICNS support, your modpack's icon can look crisp at any screen resolution and size. When an exact size isn't available, the closest one is resized and used automatically.

To see this in action, check out [this single ICO file](https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/blob/gh-pages/docs/guides/itlt/icon.ico) automatically display different sizes depending on the resolution scale:

More scales: [200%](https://zlepper.github.io/itlt/docs/changelogs/v2.0.0/200%25.png), [300%](https://zlepper.github.io/itlt/docs/changelogs/v2.0.0/300%25.png), [400%](https://zlepper.github.io/itlt/docs/changelogs/v2.0.0/400%25.png), [500%](https://zlepper.github.io/itlt/docs/changelogs/v2.0.0/500%25.png)

#### __Enhanced Vanilla Icon__

This feature uses the new icon handling system for the Vanilla icon on Windows and Linux, boosting its maximum resolution from 32px² to 48px²

### New custom window title system

Mojang have politely asked people to not completely replace existing branding, effectively taking credit for their work.

With v2, itlt respects this with new defaults and string interpolation techniques. This brings a few benefits:

-   Easier for others to troubleshoot your modpack by knowing what Minecraft version it's based on
-   The ability to vaguely tell what the player's doing by the window title (e.g. `ModpackName - Minecraft* 1.16.5 (Multiplayer)`)
-   Ability to use launcher integration and static titles simultaneously, allowing for you to name your pack "myPack" in the launcher and have the title show up as "myPack v2" for example when launching v2 of your pack, "myPack v3" when launching v3, etc...

### Multiple entries in custom server list

You can now pre-install more than one server entry to the Multiplayer menu without overwriting or removing player-added ones when updating the modpack. You can now also force the use of a server-provided resourcepack for specific preloaded server entries.

### Explicit GC

For advanced users looking to squeeze the most performance out of their game and have a reasonably good understanding of garbage collection, this feature allows you to explicitly request a GC during known points of gameplay that do not require immediate responsiveness when opened, such as pausing the game or sleeping in a bed.

This feature requires both Xms and Xmx to be set the same for it to be beneficial, ideally with the `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch` JVM arg. You must *not* use the `-XX:+DisableExplicitGC` otherwise this feature will not work at all. Due to these important requirements that have to be manually added by users, the explicit GC feature is off by default.

### Update checker support

itlt now supports the Forge update checker and will show available updates on the Mods button if enabled.

### Categorised, detailed config

All config options are categorised and have detailed comments to group similar settings together and to help you understand what every setting does. The wiki fills in additional information you may need that the config doesn't cover in enough depth.

### Miscellaneous improvements

-   The itlt entry in the mods menu now features the itlt logo.
-   When using a modern version of Java, itlt will automatically use more efficient methods with graceful fallbacks to Java 8 code. The same jar still works on Java 8 as usual.
-   Pop-up windows now attempt to use a more system-native design, with custom code for handling showing native Windows iconography rather than Swing's bundled Windows 7 icons
-   Pop-up windows are ran in a separate process so that they can persist after a game crash and to avoid causing crash-on-launch issues on older Mac OSX
-   If you run the itlt jar directly, you'll now get this message both in the console output and as a GUI dialogue box:

## Other changes

### New logo

Heavily inspired by the old logo, the new one uses the same fontface but with more visually consistent sizing and spacing. The new logo also supports transparency and different variations.

You can see the old logo here: https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/blob/gh-pages/docs/logo/old-logo.jpeg

And the new logo and all of its variations here: https://github.com/zlepper/itlt/tree/gh-pages/docs/logo

### Technical documentation

For developers, a document providing a technical overview, Q&A, todo lists and more is now available.

You can view it by going to the branch you want to work on and looking at the TechnicalDocumentation.md file.

### Issue templates

Pre-filled templates to choose from when filing a new issue that automatically labels your issue for you.
